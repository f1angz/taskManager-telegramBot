# Task Manager Telegram Bot
This telegram bot is designed to manage your tasks

## Idea
This project was supposed to be completed as a project for practice at the university, but after passing I decided to finalize it and make it my first pet project

## MVP Scope
As a user, I want to add, delete and view a list of all tasks

## How it works
Based on MVP Scope, we can specify next behaviors:
* The user can activate or stop the bot
* The user can add a task
* User can delete task
* The user can view a list of all tasks

## Technological stack

* Java as the main programming language
* JDBC for interaction with databse
* JUnit5 and Mockito for testing 
* PostgreSQL as a database
* TelegramBotApi for creating a bot
* Maven to build the project
